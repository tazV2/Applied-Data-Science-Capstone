    "Is New York and Paris overrated as tourist destinations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "New York and Paris are the most well known and visited cities of the world by the tourists. Almost all tourists either want to visit or visited these two cities. But is there any logical reason behind it? Are these two cities really that good? Sometimes people like to follow the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will show three key findings for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tourists\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Business research\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difference between two cities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection and Usage:\n",
    "New York and Paris are big cities so I took five points/locations center of the each cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For New York, five points are five locations such as Empire State Building, Museum of the City of New York,Yankee Stadium, Central park zoo and last but not least One World Trade Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four points are in the Manhattan area but I kept one place just a little out of the Manhattan which is Yankee Stadium.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Paris, Five points are Arc de Triomphe, Panthéon, Sacré-Cœur, Louvre Museum and Eiffel Tower. All of these points are center of the Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I am calling these places points because I search with the latitude and longitude coordinates. I have used Foursquare API with explore option. Foursquare did the explored the surrounding area of the coordinates and return the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned results were saved in Pandas(Data Analysis tool) pickle form and merged into csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check top five venues in each places, I have used frequency to see how many times same category appeared in each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing similarities and dissimilarities, Kmeans machine learning used to create clusters according to the similarities. To use the data to get meaningful results, I used one hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Main idea behind this study was to explore the area mainly focusing on “Does it worth it” saving for vacation and spending money after two or any of the two locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis for Tourists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis for tourists can be divide into few part based of the tourists’ preference. For individual, he/she can emphasize on any particular type of venue or site. For example, in Manhattan, New York has five theaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 theaters in Manhattan\n",
    "\n",
    "While searching Paris for art gallery, result returned only one! How so? Well, Paris center area has total 12 art museums!\n",
    "\n",
    "12 art museums\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no doubt these two places are beautiful. But when people travel in groups, everyone’s choice has to meet more or less. To check everyone’s preference, checking most common venues come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "10 Common Venues\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis for Business:\n",
    "\n",
    "This study can give help to assist business owners and analysts. For example someone wants to start a pizza shop in Manhattan. How many pizza shops are there around?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing Pizza Shops\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Above map will help to show some direction where maybe starting a pizza shop is a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities and Dissimilarities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part I have to thank machine learning to help me to put together same type of places. It is impossible to make clusters without machine learning. I found number of clusters 4 is the reasonable according to the elbow method for optimal k.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Clusters\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning I thought two places are little bit overrated as tourist destinations. But after doing some data analysis, it became clear how many varieties of things and activities these two places have to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "While collecting the data, it seemed New Work Manhattan area has parks and restaurants mostly. I did not think New York has so many gyms and creative places like theaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paris was too obvious with the museums but many hotels and tons of places to go besides museums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering two cities one of the most beautiful thing in this study. None of my guesses were right. Museum of the City of New York and Yankee Stadium each stood out. Sacré-Cœur joined with most of the Manhattan. Other four points of Paris stood in the corner but with welcoming way with hotels, creativity and many other tourist friendly places.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the times we may think what we see in front. In this data science journey, we get to see the techniques which can help us filter out from the data. Foursquare api helped a lot but searching closely and joining the data shows much more. Limit of returned results is a little bump on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, time to answer the question I started with, Is New York and Paris overrated as tourist destination? My answer is no. These two places have so many things to offer that we have to use machine learning to find the differences.\n",
    "\n",
